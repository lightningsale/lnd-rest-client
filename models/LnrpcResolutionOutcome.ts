*  - OUTCOME_UNKNOWN: Outcome unknown.  - CLAIMED: An output was claimed on chain.  - UNCLAIMED: An output was left unclaimed on chain.  - ABANDONED: ResolverOutcomeAbandoned indicates that an output that we did not claim on chain, for example an anchor that we did not sweep and a third party claimed on chain, or a htlc that we could not decode so left unclaimed.  - FIRST_STAGE: If we force closed our channel, our htlcs need to be claimed in two stages. This outcome represents the broadcast of a timeout or success transaction for this two stage htlc claim.  - TIMEOUT: A htlc was timed out on chain.
